				<h1>The 1st IEEE International Workshop on Advances in Fog, Edge, and Cloud Computing (FECC 2021)</h1>
				<br>
				<h2>In conjunction with the 18th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Smart Systems (<a href="https://eng.auburn.edu/conference/ieee-mass2021/">IEEE MASS 2021</a>)</h2>
				<h2>October 4 - 7, 2021, Denver, CO, USA</h2>

					<h2>THE WORKSHOP SCOPE</h2>
						<p>  Recent rapid advances in Mobile Cellular Networks, Cloud Computing, and Big Data have introduced Fog/Edge Computing as an interesting topic to the research community. 
						Since its first appearance, the Fog/Edge Computing has received much attention from practitioners, scholars, and the general public. 
						Considering that we are in the era of big data, many applications, such as the Internet of Things, Mobile Social Networks, and Smart City, keep generating data and interacting with the remote data centers all the time, which creates unique requirements and new challenges on the computation, storage, and communication. 
						Thanks to the idea of the Fog/Edge Computing, tasks can be mitigated from the heavy-weighted data center to local devices, which not only reduces the workload of the data center but also accelerates the average serving speed. 
						Many new techniques have been developed and are adopted in the Fog/Edge Computing. 
						Due to the benefits of using Fog/Edge Computing, many emergent applications are now available for individuals, business enterprises, and governments. 
						To this end, this workshop aims to create a platform for scholars, industry professionals, and government officials to discuss and share new research ideas and technologies in the Edge/Fog Computing and related applications.</p>
