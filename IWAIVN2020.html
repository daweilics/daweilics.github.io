		  <h1>THE WORKSHOP SCOPE: </h1> 
	      <p>Recent rapid advances in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks, Wireless Networks, and Sensor Devices have introduced Vehicular Network as an interesting topic to the research community, one that has received much attention from practitioners, scholars, and the public. The Vehicular Network, also known as Inter-Vehicle Communication Network, focuses on the spontaneous creation of a wireless communication network among vehicles, and further providing better transportation for users. Considering that we are in the era of Intelligence, many technologies and applications emerge to develop a more sustainable, efficient, and safe transportation system, such as smart traffic management systems and autonomous car systems. However, there are still many open research problems in this field, such as security and privacy issues during the data communication, green vehicle routing, and the integration of sensors, vehicular network, data center, and the existing transportation systems. To this end, this workshop aims to create a platform for scholars, industry professionals, and government officials to discuss and share new research idea and technologies in the Vehicular Network and its applications. </p>

		  <h2>REGISTRATION:</h2>
				<p>MASS has a special one-day registration for workshops. This registration is only for the day of the events. At least one author of an accepted workshop paper must register at the full workshop rate by July 30, 2020. The student discount cannot be applied to meet the registration requirement for accepted workshop papers. Workshop paper authors may register at the full conference rate to access the whole conference. Extra pages can be purchased for workshop papers and poster/demo abstract at a cost of $125 each, up to two pages. </p>

				<p>Full workshop papers have a page limit of 6. Our workshop also accepts short papers. But please note that the flat registration rate is applied for all types of workshop papers, i.e., workshop full papers and short papers should all be registered at the same registration rate. $125 per extra page with up to 2 pages is allowed for all types of workshop papers.</p>
